Testing
-------

* Avoid `any_instance` in rspec-mocks and mocha. Prefer [dependency injection].
* Avoid `its`, `let`, `let!`, `specify`, and `before` in RSpec.
* Avoid using `subject` explicitly *inside of an* RSpec `it` block.
[Example][subject-example].
* Avoid using instance variables in tests.
* Disable real HTTP requests to external services with
`WebMock.disable_net_connect!`.
* Don't test private methods.
* Test background jobs with a [`Delayed::Job` matcher].
* Use [stubs and spies] \(not mocks\) in isolated tests.
* Use a single level of abstraction within scenarios.
* Use an `it` example or test method for each execution path through the method.
* Use [assertions about state] for incoming messages.
* Use stubs and spies to assert you sent outgoing messages.
* Use a [Fake] to stub requests to external services.
* Use integration tests to execute the entire app.
* Use non-[SUT] methods in expectations when possible.
