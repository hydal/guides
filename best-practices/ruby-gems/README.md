Ruby Gems
---------

* Declare dependencies in the `<PROJECT_NAME>.gemspec` file.
* Reference the `gemspec` in the `Gemfile`.
* Use [Appraisal] to test the gem against multiple versions of gem dependencies
(such as Rails in a Rails engine).
* Use [Bundler] to manage the gem's dependencies.
* Use [Travis CI] for Continuous Integration, indicators showing whether GitHub
pull requests can be merged, and to test against multiple Ruby versions.
