NodeJS
------

* Prefer to use modules as a way of dividing up code by functionality.
* Prefer modules to have their own API of testable methods.
* Use the two frameworks [Express.JS] or [Restify] only.
* Use ES6 over ES5 with [Tracer] to handle coversion.
* Use server side rendering to speed up page load.
* Use DTrace for profiling.
* Avoid server side rendering an entire page, only the necessary parts.
