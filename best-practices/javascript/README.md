JavaScript
----------

* Avoid using frameworks.
* Avoid using promises over callbacks ([they are slower]).
* Don't use JQuery or any library that relies on JQuery.
* Prefer using a series of libraries over a framework.
* Use ES6 over ES5 with [Tracer] to handle conversion
* Use Google's [Closure-Compiler] to remove dead-code from files.
